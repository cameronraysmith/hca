% \caption{{\bf Example symmetries of robustness.} In this example, the connected component sizes are fixed at $\{2,1,1\}$ with a total of $3$ links between them. Red arrows correspond to transformations like \reffighiertransformations a where SCCs are swapped whereas purple arrows correspond to transformations like \reffighiertransformations b where links are moved between nodes within a SCC. (A) shows all underlying graphs while (B) shows the number of nodes in each SCC and the number of links between the SCCs.}
